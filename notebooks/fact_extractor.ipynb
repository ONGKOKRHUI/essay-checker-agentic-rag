Student Essay Submission \\nTitle \\nBeyond Prohibition: Integrating Generative AI into Higher Education Assessment \\nand Learning \\n \\nIntroduction \\nThe rapid emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT \\nand Claude, has fundamentally disrupted the landscape of higher education. While \\ndigital tools have long supported academic study, GenAI’s ability to synthesise complex \\ninformation and generate human-like text presents unprecedented challenges to \\nestablished educational norms. \\nA key concern among educators is the threat these tools pose to academic integrity, \\nparticularly in relation to traditional assessment methods. However, an exclusive focus \\non these risks overlooks the significant potential of GenAI to enhance personalised \\nlearning. \\nThis essay argues that although GenAI undermines the reliability of conventional essay-\\nbased assessments, it also offers meaningful benefits for student engagement and skill \\ndevelopment. As a result, universities should move beyond outright prohibition and \\nadopt a policy of critical integration by redesigning assessments to coexist with \\nemerging technologies. The discussion will first explore challenges to academic \\nintegrity, then examine learning benefits, and finally address the need for assessment \\nreform. \\n \\nBody Paragraph 1: Challenges to Academic Integrity \\nThe most immediate challenge posed by GenAI is the erosion of academic integrity in \\ntraditional written assessments. Coursework that relies heavily on knowledge \\nsummarisation or standard essay writing is especially vulnerable to AI-generated \\nplagiarism. Baron (2023) highlights that existing plagiarism detection software \\nincreasingly struggles to distinguish between human and AI-produced text, creating a \\n“crisis of trust” in grading systems. \\nThis issue stems from the way GenAI generates original outputs by predicting word \\nsequences rather than copying text verbatim, allowing it to evade similarity-based \\ndetection tools (Zhang & Li, 2024). As a result, students can submit high-quality work \\nwith limited cognitive engagement, undermining the credibility of academic \\nqualifications.'),\n",

Consequently, continued reliance \\non take-home essays as a primary measure of learning is becoming increasingly \\nunsustainable. \\n \\nBody Paragraph 2: Benefits for Student Learning \\nDespite integrity concerns, GenAI offers significant opportunities to enhance learning \\nthrough personalisation and instant feedback. Unlike human tutors, AI tools can provide \\ncontinuous academic support without time constraints. Chen et al. (2024) demonstrate \\nthat when AI is used as a Socratic tutor—prompting learners through guided questioning \\nrather than direct answers—students show improved critical thinking skills, particularly \\nin STEM disciplines. \\nThis indicates that GenAI can effectively scaffold learning by adapting explanations to \\nindividual proficiency levels. Additionally, language and formatting support offered by AI \\nallows students, especially second-language writers, to focus on higher-order thinking \\nrather than surface-level accuracy (EduTech Future, 2023). \\nTherefore, rather than replacing learning, GenAI can function as an assistive tool that \\nbroadens access to academic support and enhances learner autonomy. \\n \\nBody Paragraph 3: The Need for Assessment Reform \\nGiven both the risks and benefits of GenAI, assessment reform represents the most \\nsustainable response. Universities must shift from evaluating what students know to \\nassessing how they apply knowledge in conjunction with technology. A prohibition-\\nfocused approach fails to acknowledge that AI literacy is increasingly expected in \\nprofessional contexts (World Economic Forum, 2024). \\nAssessment methods should evolve to include oral examinations, reflective portfolios, \\nand tasks that require critical evaluation of AI-generated outputs. The University of \\nManchester Teaching Framework (2023) emphasises the importance of prioritising \\nlearning processes over final products, encouraging students to demonstrate inquiry, \\nverification, and reflection skills. \\nBy embedding AI use within assessment design—such as asking students to critique \\nflawed AI responses—institutions can cultivate critical digital literacy that aligns with \\ncontemporary academic and workplace demands. \\n \\nConclusion'),\n",
