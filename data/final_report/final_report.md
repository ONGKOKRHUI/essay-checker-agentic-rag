### **Annotated Text Review**  

#### **Strengths**  
1. **Relevance & Argumentation**  
   - Thesis is consistently supported with balanced analysis of challenges (e.g., academic integrity) and benefits (e.g., personalized learning).  
   - Strong use of evidence (e.g., Chen et al., 2024; World Economic Forum, 2024).  

2. **Structure & Flow**  
   - Effective introduction and conclusion framing the debate.  
   - Paragraphs follow a logical sequence, though transitions could be smoother (e.g., between Body Paragraphs 1 and 2).  

3. **Language & Style**  
   - Advanced vocabulary (e.g., "scaffold," "pedagogical") and formal tone.  
   - Paraphrasing is generally successful, with no direct quotations.  

#### **Areas for Improvement**  
1. **Referencing**  
   - One uncorroborated source ("EduTech Future, 2023").  
   - Minor citation formatting inconsistencies (e.g., British vs. American spelling).  

2. **Depth of Analysis**  
   - Some claims (e.g., "enforcement of strict bans is largely ineffective") lack robust evidence.  

3. **Grammar & Mechanics**  
   - Spelling inconsistency: "synthesise" (UK) vs. "synthesize" (US).  
   - Punctuation error: *"crisis of trust"* should use single quotes for British English.

### **Final Feedback**  
This essay demonstrates a **high level of academic proficiency**, with a compelling argument for the critical integration of GenAI in higher education. Strengths include **strong task fulfilment, coherent structure, and sophisticated language use**. To achieve a **Band 9-10**, refine transitions between sections, ensure all sources are verifiable, and deepen analysis of underdeveloped claims (e.g., sustainability of assessment reform).  

**Recommendation:** Minor revisions to referencing and transitions would elevate this already strong submission to an exemplary level.  

**Examiner’s Note:** The student’s stance aligns with emerging pedagogical trends, making this a timely and insightful contribution to the discourse on AI in education.
