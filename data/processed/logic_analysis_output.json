Strengths include strong source integration and clear thesis alignment. Weaknesses include minor structural transitions and limited exploration of ethical considerations beyond plagiarism. To improve, the student could: 1) Sharpen transitions between challenge/benefit sections; 2) Expand discussion of ethical dilemmas (e.g., data privacy); 3) Provide more concrete examples of redesigned assessments."
